R-891 Research Findings Log #0193
Date: September 21, 05

Progress has been inconclusive ever since Incident #008, but the team has made a new, very promising method of control.

We're calling it "Inspire"; a unique procedure that, assuming it goes well, could give us complete control of E-891.

Preparations for tomorrow's trial are almost done. All the necessary programs have been loaded onto the sub-terminal. There was a hiccup with the subject yesterday, but he's signed the release.

Transportation is scheduled for the subject in about 2 hours, he won't remember a thing, as usual.

Testing will begin with a Stimulation to wake E-891 up, followed immediately by Inspiration. If Inspire has any chance of nullifying E-891, it stands to reason it should be applied as soon as possible.

Of course it's not guaranteed Inspire will work. If it doesn't, then we're back to square one.

It's still a lofty goal, controlling... what was the term she used? A Bored God, but I'm confident this team has the means and willpower to do it.
