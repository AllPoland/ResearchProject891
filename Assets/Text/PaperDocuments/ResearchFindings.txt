R-891 Research Findings Log #0193
Date: September 21, 05

Progress is still inconclusive ever since Incident
#008, but the team is working on new methods of
control.

First on the list is what we're calling "Inspire",
a unique stimulation that - assuming it goes well -
could give us complete control over E-891.

Preparations for tomorrow's trial are almost done.
All the necessary programs have been loaded onto
the sub-terminal, and the subject has signed the
release forms.

Transportation is scheduled for the subject in
about 2 hours, they won't remember a thing, as
usual.

Testing will begin with a Stimulation to wake E-891
up, followed immediately by Inspiration. If Inspire
has any chance of nullifying E-891, it stands to
reason it should be applied as soon as possible.

Of course it's not guaranteed E-891 will be
dormant. If it isn't, Inspire will likely need to
be delayed until the next trial.

It's still a hard ask to control a - what was that
term she used? Bored God, but I'm confident this
team has the means and willpower to make it happen.
