- No, you're not going. I won't let you.

- It's ok. The research is almost over, right?
  If I'm able to finish it, that's worth it.

- Nick! Your life is worth way more than some
  stupid research. They're not even sure this
  one will work.

- You better not be calling your own work stupid.

- It's stupid when it's going to kill you!

- It's not gonna kill me. The new method's gonna
  work, and I'll come back ok. Trust me.

- I trust you, but I don't trust them... or me.

- Look, whatever <i>you</i> decide, I'm gonna go. If the
  decision's out of your hands, you won't be
  responsible for whatever happens, right?

- I'm already responsible for dozens of others.
  I won't let it happen again. Not with you.

- Hayley...

- I'll talk to Abernathy. I- I'll ask for more
  time, and we'll figure something out, ok?
