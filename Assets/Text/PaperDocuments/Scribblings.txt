This is insanity

They want me to sit here for 30 days? Really?

This isn't normal
Nothing is normal
The walls shouldn't sound like that

The door is gone.
Not like it was destroyed or something
It's just gone, like it was never there

This cant be real right
Some of this has to be real
Theres no way

cant let anybody start this shit again
locked all the computer functions
keep that thing asleep in there

wait but that one
the zap might hurt it
here just in case

the zap password is OUROBOROS
only use it if you need to

you hear me

only if you need to
