R-891 Research Findings Log #006
Date: May 25, 05

This is so much bigger than we thought.

E-891 is... unique, even among the Aberration class entities. If our trials so far haven't been a fluke, we might be able to control E-891's influence.

Abernathy has already given the go-ahead, and we've pivoted our research efforts into developing a way to control E-891.

Collins is opposed to the new process as it breaks several safety measures, but even she recognizes the potential here. We can't afford <i>not</i> to try.

The biggest hurdle in all of this will be the lack of test subjects.

Only a select few of us are able to replicate the results in trial 3, and we can't be sure everyone comes back from U-027, so we only have a few trials to develop this technology.

Research is expected to run for 2-3 months. The prospect of world altering technology on the horizon is exciting, but many lives are at stake.

We'll have to work diligently and carefully, and I plan to ensure we take no unnecessary risks.
