R-891 Research Findings Log #024
Date: September 21, 05

Research has been inconclusive for some time now, but the team has made a new, very promising method of control.

We're calling it "Inspire"; a unique procedure that, assuming it goes well, could give us complete control of E-891.

Preparations for tomorrow's trial are almost done. All the necessary programs have been loaded onto the sub-terminal. There was a hiccup with the subject yesterday, but he's signed the release.

Transportation is scheduled for about 5 hours from now. He won't remember a thing, as usual.

Testing will begin with a Stimulation to wake E-891 up, followed immediately by Inspiration. If Inspire has any chance of nullifying E-891, it stands to reason it should be applied as soon as possible.

Of course it's not guaranteed Inspire will work. If it doesn't, then we're back to square one and almost out of test subjects.

Controlling a... "Bored God" is a lofty goal, but I'm confident this team has the means and the willpower to do it.
