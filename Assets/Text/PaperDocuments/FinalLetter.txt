Hayley,

I don't blame you.

I don't hate you.

I didn't make it out, but I'm ok! They're here with me. They're all here.

Nobody died. There's no blood on your hands.

Last week, I joined them, but I wasn't able to do it.

They sent you after me to finish it, didn't they?

Don't worry, you did it.

Your work has payed off, you'll save so many lives.

The world is about to change, and we'll be part of it. I'll still be there with you.

You won't see me, but I'll be there.

There's so much left, so keep pushing through.

You're the only one who could do this.

Love, Nicholas Collins
