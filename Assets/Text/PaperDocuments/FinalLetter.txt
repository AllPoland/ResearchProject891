Hayley,

You came here looking for me, didn't you? I know from the outside it would look like I died, but you knew better.

You remember, right? You must remember. Those drugs they gave us aren't permanent.

We both have it. We speak to the Aberrations. It didn't want you to find me, but I was able to control it.

We got this far because of that, and now we can finally end it. No more death, no more pain. We'll use this entity to change the world.

I know it was hard, you had no choice but to send people to die. You had to send me, but it's all over now.

I don't blame you.

I don't hate you.

This is the end for me, but for you... There's a new world for you. Go back out there and see it for me.

Love, Nick
