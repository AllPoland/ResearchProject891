Hayley,

I don't blame you.

I don't hate you.

You came here looking for me, didn't you? I know from the outside it would look like I died, but you knew better.

You remember, right? You must remember. Those drugs they gave us aren't permanent.

We both have it, we can speak to the Aberrations. It didn't want you to find me, but I was able to help you because of our connection.

You came here because I told you to, and now we can finally end it. No more death, no more pain. We'll use this entity to change the world.

I know it was hard, you had to send people to their deaths, but it's all over now.

Thank you.

This is the end for me too, but for you... There's still so much left. Go back out there and do it for me.

Love, Nick
