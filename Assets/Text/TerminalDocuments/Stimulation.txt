STIMULATION FUNCTION ENABLED

> Testing Procedures: Stimulation

---------------------------------------------

To encourage activity from the entity, a
moderate electrostatic shock will be
administered.

Like all standard procedures, human
intervention is required. Click on the
"Stimulation" function in the terminal's main
screen to begin.

To generate sufficient power for a shock, all
capacitors must be aligned by a researcher.
Capacitors come in 3 forms: positive, negative,
or neutral.

On the Stimulation screen, there are 4 static
pylons, each surrounded by 4 capacitors.
Click the arrows on a pylon to move the
nearby capacitors.

For alignment to work, each type of capacitor
needs to be positioned differently.

Positive capacitors must be next to only a
positive pylon.

Negative capacitors must be next to only a
negative pylon.

Neutral capacitors may be placed anywhere.

Once all capacitors are aligned, the
stimulating shock will be performed, and
research equipment will begin recording
activity data.
