Subject E-891A
Entity Class: Aberration

E-891A is an entity of undefined mass, volume
and proportion.

E-891A has no distinguishable appearance, and
is rarely physically recorded by any means.

E-891A is secured through displacement. The
facility and surrounding area is to be kept
clear of all possible threats and at-risk
individuals.

As an Aberration class entity, E-891A is
known to produce shifts in nearby
individuals. Unlike most Aberration class
entities, however, E-891A remains active
primarily when in proximity of a lone target.

To facilitate a safe research environment,
stay in view of a research partner at all
times. Additionally, maintain a distance of
at least 100 meters between any researcher
and the subject. Obstructions such as walls
and windows are ineffective.

Should E-891A become active, evacuate all
researchers who are not yet affected. Do not
attempt to rescue affected individuals.
Following an incident, allow at least 72
hours before re-entering a one kilometer
radius of E-891A.
