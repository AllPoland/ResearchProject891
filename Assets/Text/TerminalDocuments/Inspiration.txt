INSPIRE FUNCTION ENABLED

> Testing Procedures: Inspiration

---------------------------------------------

Inspiration is a new procedure that is
applied after an Aberration class entity has
become active. Its effects are still unknown,
but it theoretically yields positive results.

To inspire the entity, a short sequence of
tones will be played by the researcher and
transmitted into the observation room.

Click the "Inspire" function on the
terminal's main screen, where you will find a
virtual keyboard.

Click on the button labelled "Begin". A
series of note indicators will fall from the
top of the screen. Click on the matching key
just as the indicator reaches the bottom to
hit a note.

In order for Inspiration to be successful,
the majority of notes must be hit with the
correct time and pitch.

Progress is indicated by the bar just below
the keyboard. The procedure can be repeated
as many times as necessary until it is
successful.
