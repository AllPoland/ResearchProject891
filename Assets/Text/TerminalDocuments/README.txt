Collins   | I can't do it.

Abernathy | What do you mean "I can't do it,"
            You signed up for this.
            Do. Your. Job.

Collins   | I- it's not that I-
            They can't...

> Pause for 1.38 seconds

Abernathy | They can't WHAT. Spit it out. Are
            you going to keep wallowing in
            your self-righteous bullshit, or
            are you going to be a hero?

Collins   | Hero? Ma'am, with all due
            respect, that's total-

Abernathy | No! I won't hear it, and you will
            NOT back out on the last trial
            before it's all over. Are you
            going to let the lives you've
            already sacrificed be in vain?

> Pause for 2.03 seconds

Abernathy | ARE YOU!?

> Pause for 9.71 seconds

Abernathy | Transport comes in two days. If
            they haven't signed the release
            by then, you're going in their
            stead.

Collins   | You can't be serious!

Abernathy | I'm dead serious. We're at the
            finish line. Someone has to go.
            Someone with the aberrant
            connection, which now only
            includes only you and them.

Collins   | So you'll throw this ultimatum
            at me!? No - like - delays, or
            time to consider other options?

Abernathy | DELAYS!? You're going to sit
            there and talk to me about
            delays!? This whole project is
            months behind schedule because of
            you.

Collins   | Sorry your precious schedule
            didn't account for murder
            charges! Probably should've
            thought about that before you,
            y'know, murdered people?

Abernathy | I'm done. 24 hours.
            You or them. Will be a hero, or
            are you a coward?

            Your choice.
